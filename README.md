##About
This bot is an in-progress collection of art bot experiments by me.  
The source code is for the free, easy to use tool http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/.
  
Experiments include:  
- using emojis to create visuals
- support messages trough emojis
- inspiring art creation by visually oriented place descriptions

##Tips
- On Twitter, certain unicode symbols turn into emojis. You can use Lists such as https://t.co/IvzCX2y5ep to find the unicode symbol for an emoji. You then can copy&paste them in CheapBotsDoneQuick (they will turn into Emojis after being tweeted).
- http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/ is easy enough to use, to have a playful, toy-like approach to bot making. This can yield very interesting results.
